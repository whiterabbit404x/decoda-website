-- Decoda Platform — reviewed links between legacy product organizations and
-- platform organizations. Additive only.
--
-- A product that existed before the shared identity (RWA Guard today) has its
-- own organizations. When an operator imports a reviewed legacy manifest
-- (`npm run platform:import-legacy -- --apply`), every legacy organization it
-- imports is recorded here against the platform organization created (or
-- chosen) for it. The product then links its own organization row to the
-- platform organization on the first Decoda sign-in into it — only through
-- this reviewed row, never by name, domain or membership guesswork.
--
-- One legacy organization maps to exactly one platform organization per
-- product, and vice versa. Rows are written only by the reviewed import.
--
-- Rollback: drop the view and the table (nothing else references them).
